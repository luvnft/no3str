# NOSTR3

Nostr3 is here to make your life easier when dealing with the Nostr protocol! It cleverly generates private keys right from your EVM address, taking the hassle out of key storage.

Need your keys?
Just a quick interaction with Nostr3, and you are all set.
What's more, it links your Nostr accounts to your EVM accounts, making tipping a breeze for all Nostr accounts set up through Nostr3.
While Nostr3 isn't a full-fledged Nostr protocol client, it's a super handy tool that covers the basics.
But hey, for the best Nostr experience, we suggest pairing it with open-source clients. Happy Nostring!
